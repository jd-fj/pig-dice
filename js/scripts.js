// 2 When roll is clicked it will generate a random number between 1-6.
// | Generate roll number | Player clicks roll | a random number between 1-6 is generated |

// 3. If a 1 is rolled, player score is set to 0
// | A 1 is rolled | roll = 1 | overallScore = 0 |

// 4. If a 1 is rolled, player turn is over
// | A 1 is rolled | roll = 1 | End Player Turn |

// 5. If number != 1, number is added to roundScore
// | a number other than 1 is rolled | roll = 3 | 3 is added to roundScore |

// 6. If play clicks "hold" their turn is over
// | Player clicks "hold" | Player clicks "hold" | end player turn |

// 7. If player clicks "hold" roundScore is added to overallScore.
// | Player clicks "hold" | Player clicks "hold" | roundScore is added to players overallScore. |

// 8. Once a players overallScore reaches scoreLimit, game is over.
// | Player overallScore reaches scoreLimit | Player overallScore reaches scoreLimit | Game is Over |
